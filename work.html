<p>This is my python game that I made in Canopy. We based our creation off the popular game, Mab Libs. The player will have a chose between two stories, either option 1 or option 2. After they decide which one they want to play, the user enter the command, 1 or 2, and then is taken to the game. The program will ask the user to answer a series of demmands. These demands include statements like "Enter a plural noun" or "Enter a company name". After the player answers all of the questions, their responses are inputed into a short story that the person and read and enjoy.</p></center>

<p>This is another pyton project made through Canopy. In this project the goal was to alter or manipulate an specific image. As a team we chose to alter an image of spongebob. We chose to manipulate the darker, black shades of color in the image. Then we randomized switch pixels would actually change to a different color. If the pixels were really dark, the pixels changed to green, and if the shade of color was dark, but not completely black, the pixels changed to pink.</p>

<center><p>This is my Python GUI project that I made in Canopy. Basically, my GUI has 4 functions. Firstly, it has the ability to create a new window once the user presses "file" and then "create new file". Also, when you click "click here for a surprise message" it pops up with a window saying "Nami is a cool guy". Also, it has a text box that you can type in. Lastly, it has another button called "Nami at choir?" and when it is presed it redirects the user to the youtube video of the choir concert.</p>
